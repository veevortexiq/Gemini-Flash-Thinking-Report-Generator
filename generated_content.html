        <h2>Competitive Benchmarking</h2>
        <section id=website-sales-performance>
            <h3>Website Sales Performance</h3>
            <p><strong>Average Order Value (AOV):</strong> Richer sounds' AOV of £161.49 over the last 7 days is generally considered healthy and above average for many e-commerce sectors. Industry standards for AOV vary widely depending on the product category, but for electronics and related goods, this AOV suggests a customer base willing to spend on higher-value items.</p>
            <p><strong>Order Volume:</strong> With an average of 20 orders per day and a total of 139 orders in the last 7 days, the order volume appears to be on the lower side. While the AOV is strong, increasing order volume is crucial for revenue growth. Benchmarking against industry averages for similar e-commerce businesses would be beneficial to determine if the current order volume is underperforming.</p>
            <p><strong>Discount Usage:</strong> The low number of orders with discounts applied (average of 1 per day) suggests that discount strategies are either not being heavily utilized or are not effectively promoted. In a competitive e-commerce landscape, strategic use of discounts can be a significant driver of sales. Industry benchmarks often show a higher percentage of orders utilizing discounts, especially during promotional periods.</p>
        </section>
        <section id=pricing-analysis>
            <h3>Pricing Analysis</h3>
            <p>The data indicates a low amount of discount used (£117.01 total in 7 days), which, combined with a healthy AOV, could suggest that current pricing strategies are effective at capturing value. However, the low discount usage also presents an opportunity. Strategic discounting, when implemented correctly, can attract price-sensitive customers and increase overall order volume without significantly impacting overall profitability, especially if targeted at specific products or customer segments. Benchmarking against competitors' pricing and discount strategies could reveal opportunities for optimization.</p>
