<h2>Competitive Benchmarking</h2>
<p>Based on industry standards and the provided data, here's a competitive benchmarking analysis:</p>

<h3>Website Sales Performance</h3>
<p><b>Average Order Value (AOV):</b> The current AOV of approximately $143.89 over the last year is within a reasonable range for e-commerce, especially for electronics. Industry averages can vary widely, but focusing on increasing AOV through upselling and cross-selling is a common strategy for improvement.</p>
<p><b>Conversion Rate:</b>  Without website traffic data, a direct conversion rate cannot be calculated. However, focusing on improving site speed and user experience, as recommended in the Action Plan, is crucial for enhancing conversion rates, which typically benchmark around 1-3% in e-commerce, and can be higher for top performers.</p>
<p><b>Refund Rate:</b> The refund rate, implied by 256 refund orders out of 9126 total orders in the last year (approximately 2.8%), is within an acceptable range for e-commerce. However, reducing this further through quality improvements and better product descriptions can enhance customer satisfaction and reduce operational costs.</p>

<h3>Pricing Analysis</h3>
<p><b>Discount Usage:</b> The low usage of discounts suggests potential opportunities to strategically employ discounts to drive sales. Industry best practices often involve targeted discounts for specific customer segments or product categories to maximize impact without eroding profitability.</p>

<h3>Digital Shelf Performance</h3>
<p><b>Product Presentation:</b> Addressing site load times is directly related to digital shelf performance. Faster loading product pages improve product visibility and customer engagement, aligning with best practices for online merchandising.</p>

<li><b>Agent 4 - On-Page SEO Product:</b>  To implement upselling and cross-selling strategies effectively, optimizing product descriptions and content is essential.
