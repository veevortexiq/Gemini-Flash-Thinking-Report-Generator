This will execute the `app.js` file, which uses the Gemini AI model to generate the report based on the prompt and data provided in the script. The generated report will be saved as an HTML file named `generated_content.html`.

## Project Structure

*   `app.js`: Contains the main application logic, including the integration with the Google Gemini AI model and the report generation process.
*   `package.json`: Lists the project dependencies and scripts.
*   `generated_content.html`: The output file containing the generated HTML report.

## Dependencies

*   `@google/generative-ai`: Google's Generative AI client library for Node.js.
*   `fs`: Node.js file system module for writing the generated content to a file.

## Troubleshooting

*   If you encounter a `TypeError: genAI.getGenerativeModel is not a function` error, ensure that you are using a compatible version of the `@google/generative-ai` library and that the `getGenerativeModel` method is correctly called.
*   If the generated report is incomplete or contains errors, review the prompt and input data in `app.js` to ensure they are accurate and properly formatted.
*   Ensure your API key is correctly set and that your Google Cloud project has the Gemini API enabled.
